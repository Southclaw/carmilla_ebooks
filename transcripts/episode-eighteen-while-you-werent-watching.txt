EPISODE EIGHTEEN: WHILE YOU WEREN'T WATCHING
 more 
LAURA:
I don't understand. We caught her. This shouldn't be happening. Natalie shouldn't be missing and Sarah Jane shouldn't be...
[Danny and LaFontaine enter]
DANNY:
Well, you were right. These stupid cards were there in both their dorms.
LAFONTAINE:
And I took a bunch of samples. We'll figure out what the sludge is.
DANNY:
It looks like the plan was to take both of them, so maybe what happened to Sarah Jane was an accident.
KIRSCH:
She fell.
LAURA:
What?
KIRSCH:
We were all watching the fire from the third floor balcony. And then... And she kept asking me to go to the party... And I kept telling her, babe, we're at the party... And then... and then we noticed Natalie went missing, and- and everyone went to look for her. Except SJ, because well, I was worried about her, so I told her to stay put. And I locked the door and she should've been safe. And then we heard her scream, and then... they've must've tried to take her and she must've fallen. [to Carmilla] Hey, why'd you do that to her, huh? What did she ever do to you? [shakes Carmilla]
DANNY:
She wasn't there, okay? She wasn't there. [Kirsch hugs Danny]
KIRSCH:
Thanks so much, psycho. I'm gonna... You know, at times like these a dude needs to be with his bros. 
[Kirsch leaves, Danny goes to close the door behind him]
LAURA:
[sighs] Oh my gosh. This is such a mess. What are we gonna do now?
[Carmilla coughs]
Oh, crap.
LAFONTAINE:
Yep. That is a dilemma. 
LAURA:
This day just keeps getting better and better. 
PERRY:
Well, don't look at me. I didn't want to kidnap anyone to begin with!
DANNY:
Well, we can't just let her go! She still might be involved. 
LAFONTAINE:
Also, and I'm just throwing this out there, but it took, like, eight people to subdue her and she seems kinda angry.
LAURA:
Right. Definitely not untying angry vampire.
PERRY:
You can't just keep a hostage in your dorm room, Laura! I mean, I know this is Silas, but somebody is bound to notice if you keep a girl trussed up in here for god knows how long.
LAFONTAINE:
You really think that, huh?
I could take her to the bio lab. I'm sure there's all sorts of things we could figure out through some minimally invasive probing. [off Perry and Laura's "????" looks] Or a voluntary questionnaire. 
DANNY:
We could take her to the summer society department. There's a storage room in the back...
LAURA:
No! She's our only lead. She stays exactly where she is until she tells us what's going on and how she's involved. If we get caught, you guys can just blame me. Worst thing they can do is expel me, and by comparison, that's not seeming too dire. 
LAFONTAINE:
It'll seem dire once they start your tribunal.
LAURA:
My what now?
PERRY:
You really need to read your student handbook.
LAURA:
Okay, no. Focus.
[everyone huddles around Laura. Perry covers Carmilla's ears]
If we're gonna break her, we need to girl the hell up. United front. No mercy. Am I right? [looks at each redhead] Okay.
Alright, vampire. We know that you've been stalking those girls and we know that... you're a vampire! So the sooner you 'fess up and tell us what's going on, the better this is gonna go for you because we have got a... spatula and a stapler and we are not afraid to use them, so you better start singin'!
LAFONTAINE:
Uh, Laura... She's still got the... [gestures to mouth]
LAURA:
Oh, right. Uh, maybe this will get you talking. [rips tape off of Carmilla's mouth]
Ooh. So, spill. How do two more girls end up kidnapped and murdered when we've got you tied up here?
CARMILLA:
Because I didn't do it, you dimwits.
