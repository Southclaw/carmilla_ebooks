LAURA:
Oh my god oh my god oh my god! Mph! Okay. Okay. Not dead. Not dead. Oh my god, my dad is gonna kill me.
[Carmilla comes back in, starts throwing things into a bag]
Okay, seriously?!
CARMILLA:
What?
LAURA:
Uh... This! [indicates neck wound]
CARMILLA:
You're not dead.
LAURA:
That's it? You just use me as a human juice box and I don't even get an explanation?
CARMILLA:
Ugh! I'm a vampire and I'm pissed off. What were you expecting? I needed the strength to catch Willy Boy before he ran off to Mother and ratted me out.
LAURA:
So, did you?
CARMILLA:
(sarcastically) Yeah, I'm preparing to flee the scene because everything went to spec. The little weasel got away. It's only a matter of time before Mother comes after me.
LAURA:
So you're just gonna run? 
CARMILLA:
Have you been listening to a word I've said about my mother? Yeah!
LAURA:
And as soon as you leave they're just gonna come for me.
CARMILLA:
Well, you know what? You never had much of a chance anyway. Sorry, cutie. Nothing personal.
LAURA:
But it is! It's totally personal. Will was gonna kill me just to piss you off so you decked him. It's his word against yours that you're being all disobedient. Running, though? That'll make you look guilty for sure.
CARMILLA:
So, coincidentally, my best chance is to stay here and figure out a way to justify protecting you?
LAURA:
Funny the way things work out, huh?
CARMILLA:
Fine. But only because I have nothing resembling a better plan. And don't think that I'm not pissed off. I haven't forgotten about the past two weeks.
LAURA:
You have been lying to me since the moment that we met. And you just 
bit me
. I'm pissed too.
CARMILLA:
Fine. I'm gonna take a shower. I smell like the basement of an abattoir. 
LAURA:
Terrific! See if you can scrape all of your hair out of the shower drain while you're at it.
CARMILLA:
Fine!
LAURA:
Fine!
[Carmilla goes into the bathroom] [Laura looks at the bite]
Ohh. Holy crap. So a pack of vampires wants to kidnap me for reasons unknown and the only thing maybe stopping them is my quite possibly not as evil as they are roommate. Who just bit me. So that's not complicated. Also, I have a Lit midterm in five hours. Ugh.
