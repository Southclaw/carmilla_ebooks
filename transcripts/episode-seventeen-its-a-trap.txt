EPISODE SEVENTEEN: IT'S A TRAP
 more 
LAURA:
Behold: vampire bait! Yeah. Danny took one look and said: you look like you're about to flee your brooding lover across the moors. Which is accurate. The fluffy sleeves things, not the brooding lover thing. That's not a thing. 
So, the plan is to hit the luau, hang for a while, roast some marshmallows, lure Carmilla away so that Danny and the Zetas can grab her. Not end up digested in the process. Fingers crossed on that last part. 
[Carmilla enters]
CARMILLA:
Don't you look like a virgin sacrifice.
LAURA:
I'm not the one in a corset. Which... wow. Also, what is happening there [re: champagne that Carmilla's carrying]?
CARMILLA:
Well, the more I thought about a bonfire with those lackwits, the less interested I was. Parties should be a shimmering moment of possibility, not a collection of brutes around a piece of flaming driftwood. So, I brought the party here.
LAURA:
The party being dancing in the hallway and ludicrously expensive champagne... Where did you even find that?
CARMILLA:
I have my methods. They served champagne at the first party I ever attended.
LAURA:
You say that like it was a hundred years ago...
CARMILLA:
Feels like more than that. Like something seen underwater from a great distance. God, I'm a nostalgic idiot tonight.
You're not wearing your charm.
LAURA:
Oh! Yes! It just... didn't go with my outfit.
CARMILLA:
Well, you shouldn't've taken it off. It's not gonna work if you're not wearing it.
LAURA:
Oh. I'll be sure to tie on my cool batwing bracelet first thing [laughs nervously].
CARMILLA:
If you didn't like it, you could've just said something.
LAURA:
No! I-I totally liked it. It was really nice of you to think of me. [grabs phone, starts to text for help]
CARMILLA:
What are you doing?
LAURA:
Uh, just texting Danny and the girls, seeing if maybe they wanna join- [Carmilla snatches phones] Uh... hey.
CARMILLA:
Maybe I don't feel like sharing you right now.
LAURA:
That'd sound more flattering if it didn't make sound like a canapé. 
CARMILLA:
[chuckles and pulls Laura's chair over to her. Some of the tension goes out of Laura's body] God, what am I doing? Hm. Naïve, provincial girl. Entirely too tightly wound. Such a cliché. I oughta know better.
LAURA:
Gee, thanks.
CARMILLA:
And yet there's something about you.
LAURA:
Maybe it's my keen fashion sense.
CARMILLA:
No, it's definitely not that. 
[Danny barges in, followed by Perry, LaFontaine, Kirsch, et al.]
DANNY:
You! Get away from her!
[tackles Carmilla onto Laura's bed]
TITLE CARD: "30 feet of rope + 10 cloves of garlic + 1 mouth-sized strip of duct tape = ?..."
[Carmilla is tied to a chair, LaFontaine looks like they came out worse in a fight, Danny has a black eye, Perry is unharmed and tending to LaFontaine]
LAURA:
[to camera] Vampire captured! Even though I was unable to text for help, in an unbelievably lucky series of events, Danny got worried about my crazed plan and came to check on me. [to Danny] Thanks. How's your eye?
DANNY:
It's better now that you're safe. 
LAFONTAINE:
Also, I got my head smashed into a table, if anyone cares. And I'm pretty sure that Zeta guy Will has a fractured clavicle. I can't believe he went back to the party.
LAURA:
Bumps and bruises and the dubious legality of holding someone hostage in their own room aside, I think this is cause for a little celebration. Guys, we did it! And now that her reign of terror and flirting is over, we'll unpod SJ and Natalie, we'll find Betty, and-
[screaming from somewhere off-camera]
What was that? We caught her fair and square! There is not allowed to be some new horrible thing.
[Kirsch barges in]
KIRSCH:
Laura! You gotta come quick. It's SJ and Natalie! I think somebody's trying to take them. I can't find Natalie and I think SJ's... I think she's dead!
