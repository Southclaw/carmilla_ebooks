EPISODE TWENTY ONE: STRATEGIC PLANNING
 more 
LAURA:
So, in light of last night's many revelations we are gathering to debate the benefits of releasing our vampire hostage, right?
DANNY:
Oh my god, Laura. I don't care how soppy her tale of long lost love is. She just confessed to centuries of tricking girls into being her friend before she 
ate them
.
LAURA:
Ugh, fine. But if her mother really is the dean then don't we need all the help that we can get?
DANNY:
It's not help if we can't trust a word she says!
LAFONTAINE:
Sorry, L, not on board with untying someone who may eat me.
LAURA:
Perry? You didn't even wanna trap her in the first place!
PERRY:
Have you been listening to what she's been saying? We kidnapped 
the dean's daughter
. We can't just let her go now. Sorry, Carmilla.
CARMILLA:
Oh, don't worry about me. If you guys wanna go after my mother, I'm fine here. [addressing LaFontaine's laptop] "Vampires don't cry?" That's almost as bad as that sparkly twerp...
DANNY:
(sarcastically) Yep. Clearly we're lost without her.
LAURA:
Fine. But what are we gonna do about the dean?
[later]
CARMILLA:
[to the laptop] You're a vampire, numb nuts! Eat her! Pop culture has so much to answer for...
[Will enters]
WILL:
Well... This is pathetic. Well, they sent me to see if you'd dealt with your roommate problem yet and I see that the answer is no.
CARMILLA:
That's some big talk, fresh meat.
WILL:
This fresh meat took you down, Kitty. 
CARMILLA:
I remember. How's that collarbone feeling?
WILL:
Aaah, lucky shot. 
CARMILLA:
Hm. Untie me and we'll find out. That is what you're here for, isn't it?
WILL:
Yes [cuts Carmilla loose]. Mother says it's time to stop screwing around. No more stalling. We're gonna grab your prissy little roomie and we're gonna—
LAURA:
(waking up) Carm, can you please turn down the television? [turns on light] This is not good! Will, you need to run right now!
WILL:
Oh my god, really? Why?
LAURA:
Because... I know that we didn't really talk about this when you were helping us catch her but... she's a vampire!
WILL:
[laughs] I know. She's kinda not the only one.
LAURA:
Cool. Okay. Cool. So, with that information, I'm just gonna go... [turns to leave, but Will blocks her path]
WILL:
I'm really gonna enjoy this.
[Laura hits Will in the throat and runs into the bathroom]
Okay, ow. What the hell was that?
LAURA ("O.S."):
Uh, my father is a raging paranoid! You think he sends me day of the week bear spray but didn't sign me up for krav maga at age eight? 
WILL:
Cute. Not gonna save you.
[he kicks down the door, there's the sounds of a struggle. Will reemerges from the bathroom with Laura, whose arms are pinned]
See? This is why I miss the 1930s. You know, sure, you get the occasional gal who signs up for the ARTC, but you don't get any of this chop saki crap.
CARMILLA:
(sarcastically) Yeah, victims who fight back are so inconvenient.
WILL:
Haha, laugh it up, Kitty. I'm sure mother's gonna find it hilarious I had to cut you loose and finish your chores for you.
CARMILLA:
You... you are such a mama's boy.
WILL:
I think I'll just have a little snack now.
CARMILLA:
We don't kill the targets. [Will laughs] And I bet you're already in deep for losing the airhead.
WILL:
Well, it was an accident. I mean, how was I supposed to know that they were gonna lock her in an upstairs bedroom with a window wide open...
CARMILLA:
And now you wanna be the guy who lost two of them?
WILL:
It'd be worth it just to screw with you.
[Carmilla punches Will in the face, he lets go of Laura who jumps behind Carmilla]
You're gonna regret that, Kitty. 
[he leaves]
LAURA:
Thank you for not letting him eat me. Which was especially nice of you—
[Carmilla pins her to the bed and bites her. Laura shrieks. Carmilla runs after Will]
Uh! Oh my god oh my god oh my god.
