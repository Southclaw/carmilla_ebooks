EPISODE TWENTY SEVEN: REQUIRED READING

[theme]
LAURA:
So we survived the research trip! Which we should probably never speak of again. And here is our haul! One gnarly Sumerian book from before time began and..
LAFONTAINE:
The rescued digital consciousness of one JP Armitage, junior records clerk and Silas student, class of 1874. [they plug a USB into the computer] Say hi to the Internet, JP.
[Note: JP does not have a speaking role. All of his lines are typed and appear on the screen.]
JP:
Hello, Internet! Splendid to meet you.
LAURA:
Because somebody really did get absorbed into the library catalogue. Although, how he got sucked in, like, a hundred years before the catalogue was digitized...
JP:
Well, you see I was minding my own business one day way way back in 1874. The Autumn [sic] leaves were just turning their auburns and reds and golds when-
LAFONTAINE:
We really need to find you a better interface.
JP:
-you're right... it's kind of a long story...
LAFONTAINE:
Anyway, turns out JP has helped us before. Remember the truly stellar search results and timely warnings for us to flee from our last trip to the library? All courtesy of JP.
JP:
Glad I could be of service!
LAURA:
According to JP, there was a rash of disappearances in 1874 as well. And although he didn't have an electron microscope to suss out the brain parasites, he did get way further along than we did with his research into the 
luce esurientem
 [sic; that Latin grammar is not right] or the hungry light and the cult of vampires serving it, AKA the dean's special council. It even found reference to this special Sumerian tome that's, uh, supposed to have a section on it. Which is what he was searching for in the subbasement when he got... absorbed.
CARMILLA:
Well, wonder librarian better have more than just hungry and eats girls because that pretty much describes everything in this book. 
LAURA:
No, but there's gotta be something...
CARMILLA:
No. Mm, no. Yuggoth, raised with twelve virgins, burned at the stake... Um... Khalos [?], sprinkled with the blood of... virgins. Smeared on the roots of the sacrificial tree... Niar Logoth [?]* prefers the livers of virgins. Force fed nothing but red wine for 96 days... 
LAURA:
Eugh.
CARMILLA:
Thirteen year old boys have so much more subtlety.
LAFONTAINE:
Yeah, that's the problem with horrors from beyond the dawn of time. Their lack of subtlety. Though it is pretty cool that you can read Sumerian.
CARMILLA:
Eh, 1871 was a dull year. I decided to read Gilgamesh. 
[knock at the door. It's Perry]
PERRY:
Oh, good. You're all still here. Um, because I saw Laura's last video about going to the library and I thought I'd just... check to make sure you weren't dead. And you're not. So, that's fine.
[Perry leaves]
LAURA:
[to LaFontaine] She'll come around. You'll see. 'Cause... you're awesome and we would literally be nowhere without you. You know that, right?
LAFONTAINE:
Thanks. Come on, JP. Let's you and I hit my homunclid anatomy course and see if we can figure out anything about these parasites.
JP:
Ta ta!
[LaFontaine starts to leave]
LAURA:
Great. And we will keep reading the giant Sumerian tome of do not want.
[LaFontaine leaves]
[to Carmilla] So, thanks, by the way for coming with us to the library. 
CARMILLA:
I thought we were never speaking of that again.
LAURA:
Yeah. [chuckles nervously] You came along 'cause you wanna know what happened to her, didn't you? 'Cause you're hoping that you can save her somehow?
CARMILLA:
Don't start expecting heroic vampire crap from me, cupcake. If I know better than to mess with my mother, I sure as hell know better than to spit in the eye of something old enough to think it's a god. Besides, the wench is dead.
LAURA:
So are you. Doesn't seem to be putting a dent in your social life. Besides, if you want me to stop having heroic notions about you, you should probably stop saving my life.
CARMILLA:
Then who would buy the cupcakes?
[the next morning]
LAURA:
There is just nothing like a good night's sleep. Right, sleepyhead?
CARMILLA:
[grumpily] No.
LAURA:
I mean, I did dream about that weird black cat thing again, but I think that's just my subconscious being weird.
This morning, after a long night of fruitless research, it is more fruitless research. [Carmilla sighs] This time for my final Lit paper, on which I am woefully behind. If anyone had told me before college that fighting evil required this much paperwork, I would not have believed them.
[Perry enters]
PERRY:
Where is she? Because if she thinks this is some kind of joke, that she's trying to teach me a lesson, it is in such incredibly bad taste.
[Perry is tearing apart Laura and Carmilla's room looking for LaFontaine]
LAURA:
Where is who now?
PERRY:
Susan. Uh, LaFontaine. And I know that she's mad at me, but that is just no excuse for all this.
LAURA:
LaFontaine isn't here.
PERRY:
What? No. No. She has to be. It has to be a joke.
LAURA:
What has to be a joke?
LAFONTAINE:
Her room was a mess and this was stapled to the door. [hands Laura a notecard]
LAURA:
[reading] Dear student: your nosy little friend no longer attends Silas University because (A) she meddled in things that were none of her business (B) did you really think we wouldn't find out what you were up to Â© we are ancient and terrible (D) none of you are safe; we'll take anyone we want. Exit procedures have commenced; no action on your part is required.
