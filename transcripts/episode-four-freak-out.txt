EPISODE FOUR: FREAK OUT
 more 
LAURA:
See? Blood. In the milk container. In my creepy roommate's milk container. So, she's gotta go, right? I mean, this is like, a death threat, or a health code violation. And the time has come for Carmilla to go. 
PERRY:
Well, there's no denying it's a little odd.
LAFONTAINE:
Odd? That's where you're going with this? How many people you know take Type O with their Chokoa Crunch?
PERRY:
LaFontaine, you know you're not here in an official capacity. So, as Laura's actual floor don-
LAFONTAINE: 
[overlapping] Are you really gonna try and pretend this isn't a total freak show?
PERRY:
We haven't even given the roommate a chance to explain herself! For all we know it could be some kind of like, protein supplement.
LAFONTAINE:
For extreme hemoglobin deficiency?
PERRY:
You're not helping.
LAFONTAINE:
I know you wanna pretend the weird here's all Doctor Seuss, Perr, but in my world the alchemy club press gangs [?] test subjects in the caf. As this floor's unofficial truth speaker, I'm gonna tell frosh she needs to wise up if she intends to survive.
LAURA:
Oh, see, surviving. Yes. I like that plan. And in order to do that, we need to get rid of Carmilla.
PERRY:
Well, it's not that I don't understand, but don't you think you oughta talk to her first? A lot of problems can be solved through good communication.
LAFONTAINE:
A lot of problems can also be solved by taking hair and blood samples to figure out exactly what kind of freaky it is you're dealing with.
LAURA:
Oh, wow. That... oh, okay.
LAFONTAINE:
I'm a bio major.
LAURA:
Okay, if you can't help me, should I go to the Dean?
PERRY:
Well, that's really not a good idea.
LAFONTAINE:
Yeah, better just handle this yourself.
PERRY:
By complaining to the Dean, you'd probably just draw attention to yourself and you don't want that.
LAFONTAINE:
They could stick you with someone much worse and you don't wanna end up with some draco [?] pyromaniac, you know?
LAURA:
I'm sorry, "draco pyro" what now*? What's that-
PERRY:
Besides, your old roommate will be back soon and then Carmilla will have to move out.
LAFONTAINE: 
It's a distinct possibility.
PERRY:
It's what happened with all the other girls who disappeared.
