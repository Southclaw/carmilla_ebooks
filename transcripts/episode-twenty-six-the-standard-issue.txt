LAFONTAINE:
Gee, Perr. Tell us how you really feel.
PERRY:
Look, I get that this is all fake fun for you, Susan, but you can't just expect everyone to go along with all this insanity.
LAFONTAINE:
Like it or not, Perr, weird is the way it is.
PERRY:
That doesn't mean you need to fling yourself into every weird situation you can find headfirst. Like this nonsense where you won't even let me call you Susan anymore.
LAFONTAINE:
I don't wanna be Susan anymore.
PERRY:
Well, that's too bad because she was my friend. I don't even know who you are anymore.
[Perry leaves]
LAURA:
Are you okay?
LAFONTAINE:
Peachy. My best friend since I was five thinks I'm some sort of freak. [breathes deeply] I'd like to find something to experiment on now.
LAURA:
Yeah, or maybe just for tonight we stuff our faces with popcorn and watch bad scifi. Because I have been marked for death by a vampire cabal and you... are fighting with your best friend.
LAFONTAINE:
[nods] Yeah. That'd be good.
[later; Laura and LaFontaine are asleep on each other]
[Carmilla enters]
LAURA:
Mm... No, I can't... [jerking violently]
LAFONTAINE:
What the hell?
CARMILLA:
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Laura, Laura, Laura, Laura. Laura! Laura, you're dreaming. It was just a dream. Hey...
LAURA:
[breathing heavily] Blood... There was blood everywhere again. Filled the room until it was an ocean and... and above it this light. Nothing should shine like that. Like... the rotted heart of the world. 
LAFONTAINE:
So that's not creepy. Do you think these are still the dreams that mean she's been chosen?
CARMILLA:
She shouldn't be having these dreams anymore. The charm should have chased the vampires away.
LAURA:
I-I don't think it's a vampire. It's the girl. The girl in the nightdress.
CARMILLA:
You saw her?
LAURA:
I think so. She was... in the room as the blood rose. She didn't even try and swim. Why didn't she try and swim?
CARMILLA:
Did she say anything?
LAURA:
No. Maybe. Maybe not to go into the light 'cause... the light is hungry.
LAFONTAINE:
Awesome. I didn't need to sleep again ever.
CARMILLA:
That's everything she said?
LAURA:
Yeah. I'm sorry.
You asked about her before. It's her, isn't it? It's Ell.
CARMILLA:
I don't know. I've never seen her. The girls we take talk about her sometimes. Little girl with a mole right here [indicates to just under her right eye]? But she's never tried to say anything to me.
LAFONTAINE:
Who are we talking about now?
LAURA:
Her ex. Kind of. She got taken a long time ago. Maybe she can't get to you. Maybe it's, like, a non-vampire thing.
CARMILLA:
Sure.
LAFONTAINE:
"The light is hungry." Not to get all fascinated by weird things, but maybe it's clue. Maybe it has something to do with the second stage of the parasite.
LAURA:
Could be. But how are we going to cross reference some ancient evil light with weird parasitic brain worms in... Oh no.
[later]
CARMILLA:
How did you idiots ever trap me?
LAURA:
Just in case we... don't come back, we are recording this message.
LAFONTAINE:
We've determined that a research trip which some of you may not approve of is a necessity.
LAURA:
And since the subbasement where the archives are held only exists after dark, a day trip was out of the question. So, if you're watching this, Danny, Perry...
LAFONTAINE:
Oh, hell no. We are not apologizing to them. We are ready for the weird. We thrive on it. We tape our flamethrowers to our pulse rifles and we make the weird submit. We're goin' to the library.
[Carmilla and Laura exchange looks; Carmilla snorts]
