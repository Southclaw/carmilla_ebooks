EPISODE NINETEEN: ADVANCED INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES
 more 
LAURA:
You cannot seriously think that we're dumb enough to believe you're innocent just because you say so.
CARMILLA:
Yeah, 'cause that seems like a stretch. Look, if I were really a vampire, would I just stay here, tied up, proclaiming my innocence as some sort of trick?
LAURA:
Yeah. That's completely, exactly what a vampire would do. We have, like, forty hours of video documentation. Bet you wished you'd watched my project now, huh?
CARMILLA:
Fine. So I'm a vampire. But I couldn't have made off with either of the two cupcakes because I was here with you, and then I was here being ambushed by toddlers the whole time. 
LAURA:
Well, maybe you have some kind of... vampiric accomplice!
CARMILLA:
Do I strike you as the type of person who plays well with others?
LAURA:
Well, if you weren't snacking on coeds, what were you doing following them around at parties?
CARMILLA:
I'm a popular girl. I get a lot of invitations. Not everybody has to resort to bush league* investigative journalism to get their kicks.
LAURA:
You're a vampire!
CARMILLA:
Yeah, but not a kidnapper!
LAFONTAINE:
She's got us there. Assuming she's up to something diabolical just because she's-
LAURA:
An undead fiend from the pits of hell?
CARMILLA:
I'm from Eastern Europe. Potato, potahto. 
[knocking at the door, Perry and LaFontaine run to answer it]
PERRY:
Oh, hey! Yeah, we're actually good for beer shots right now. But thanks for thinking of us. What? Uh, no. We're rehearsing a skit. Uh, yeah, the torture scene from Arsenic and Old Lace. Mhmm. Yeah, there's a torture scene. Want more info? Buy tickets. [closes door]
Okay. As much as I appreciate that we have this whole hysterical vampire thing going on, I think it's time that we just deescalate...
LAURA:
Deescalate? She just admitted to being a 
vampire
.
PERRY:
I know. And that's insane. So, maybe she's just insane and instead of holding her here hostage we should take her to student health services. I hear they have a great collection of straight jackets and tranquilizers. [off everybody's "WTF" looks] Well, what other option do we have? Keeping her here tied up, watching her every second? Starving her until she confesses?
[Danny and Laura exchange looks]
[later]
LAURA:
Good morning, viewers! And welcome to day nine of operation stupid, obstinate vampire  roommate won't talk. Which is all she has to do and we will totally give her this nice, yummy blood to drink. Ugh, I swear.
[knocking, Laura runs to answer the door]
LAURA:
Uh, hey. No, no, Carmilla's not here right now. Uh, she had tickets to some angry, existentialist punk rock fight club thing... You know how she is...
[Carmilla having a seizure in the chair she's tied to]
Yeah, I'm sure she's totally gonna text you when she gets back. Okay. Bye. [closes door] I swear, if one more of your broken hearted study buddies comes knocking at the door I'm gonna start spritzing them like... cats. Carmilla! No! No, no, no! Please don't die, please don't die you stupid vampire! Here, look, I've got blood. Ah!
[Carmilla stops having a seizure, makes vague not (more) dead sounds]
LAURA:
Oh, thank god. 
CARMILLA:
Damnit.
LAURA:
Do you want some more?
CARMILLA:
Fine.
[Laura holds the mug of blood up so Carmilla can drink]
Where'd you get that?
LAURA:
Uh, we figured we might need some leverage so LaFontaine got it from the campus hospital. She told them it was for an experiment about hematophagy. 
Uh, you've got a little something right...
[she goes to wipe Carmilla's face, Carmilla pulls away]
LAURA:
What?
CARMILLA:
The experience of being held captive by a clutch of imbeciles for something I didn't even have the pleasure of doing is humiliating enough without having you wipe me up like a dribbling child.
LAURA:
Look, if you really want me to believe that you didn't do it, you have got to explain what you were doing at those parties. 'Cause the night that we caught you, it sure looked like you were about to eat me.
CARMILLA:
Wait, you thought that me trying to eat you?
LAURA:
Well, if you weren't trying to eat, then what were you trying to- oh. Oh. So when you were hitting on me, you were really hitting on me?
CARMILLA:
Yes. And you were luring me into a trap. Could you just stake me now? 'Cause I think that would be less mortifying than this conversation. 
LAURA:
Wow. That is... Okay, even if I was to believe you, that still wouldn't explain what you were doing at the parties and how you know all of the missing girls. If you want us to trust you, you have gotta tell us your side of the story. 
CARMILLA:
My side of the story? Alright, then. Buckle up, creampuff. We're gonna be in for a long night. Or, you know, Wednesday afternoon.
