LAURA:
I'm sorry, did you just say "all the other girls who went missing"? As in, this has happened before and nobody said anything?
PERRY:
It was nothing unusual. Just, you know, girls wanting to have a good time and getting a little carried away.
LAFONTAINE:
It was completely unusual. [addressing Laura] How do you not know about this? Both of them went missing for two days and then they just show up in a dorm room or a psych classroom with no memory of what happened to them. 
PERRY:
It was frosh week. They had too much to drink.
LAFONTAINE:
Yeah, because that causes random disappearances.
PERRY:
Susan, I swear-
LAFONTAINE:
LaFontaine.
PERRY:
Really? Fine. LaFontain-
LAURA:
Okay, whoa. I need to talk to these girls. Like, right now.
PERRY:
Oh, yeah! Of course, you should talk to them. Um, except maybe-
LAURA:
Except maybe what?
PERRY:
Well, maybe not right now. Um. They weren't hurt or anything, just shaken up, and you're a little intense.
LAURA;
Intense?
LAFONTAINE:
She means they're traumatized and you're on a mission, girl.
PERRY:
But I'll talk to them and see if they feel up to meeting you, okay?
LAURA:
Yeah, okay.
[Carmilla enters]
PERRY:
You must be Carmilla.
CARMILLA:
Must I be? [takes off shirt]
PERRY:
Well, then. So nice to have you on the floor. I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot of you. Come on, Susan. And Laura...
LAURA:
Mm?
PERRY:
Remember, communication.
[Perry exits, 
LaFontaine approaches Laura to hand her the syringe. Laura refuses
, and LaFontaine leaves]
[Laura puts away the cereal. Carmilla looks through the fridge for her blood.]
LAURA:
Yeah, you're not gonna find your "soy milk" in there.
CARMILLA:
It was just a prank. 
LAURA:
You filled a milk container with blood as a prank? 
CARMILLA:
It was food colouring and.. and... and corn syrup. 
LAURA:
Ugh, you are such a freak.
CARMILLA:
There are worse things to be.
LAURA:
Sure. How about a Carmy Cold Sore? That would be worse.
CARMILLA:
Oh, were you the one spreading those little rumours? Nice try. [sits down on bed] That bunched up little face you make when you're angry is hilarious, buttercup.
LAURA:
I wonder how hilarious it'll be when I get the dean of students to kick you out. 
CARMILLA:
[chuckles] You running to the dean? I'd pay to see that.
LAURA:
Think I won't?
CARMILLA:
Be my guest. 
[Sarah Jane and Natalie at the door]
SARAH JANE:
Sorry. Are we, like, interrupting something?
CARMILLA:
Really not.
SARAH JANE: 
Okay, cool. [addressing Carmilla] Hey, hey! Don't I know you from an intro class?
CARMILLA:
I doubt it.
SARAH JANE:
Okay. Um. I'm Sarah Jane, and this is Natalie. The floor don said Laura... Laura wanted to talk to us. 
LAURA:
Oh, yeah. Laura, that's me. 
SARAH JANE:
Okay.
LAURA:
Please, come in. Sit down.
SARAH JANE:
Thank you.
LAURA:
Ignore my roommate. She's a sociopath.
[later]
LAURA:
So, earlier this year there was a thing where you guys kind of disappeared.
CARMILLA:
Devastating interrogation technique there.
SARAH JANE:
Yeah. It was freaky, okay? One second I'm at the swim team's under the sea party. I'm, uh, downing 
Fizzy Dagons
. And then, the next thing you know, I'm in my dorm room, I'm waking up, all these people are yelling at me, they're saying I've been missing for two days...
LAURA:
[addressing Natalie] And the same kind of thing happened to you?
NATALIE:
Yeah, like, I was at a wine and cheese and then I was standing in the middle of a lecture hall a day and a half later. Nothing in between.
SARAH JANE:
Right.
LAURA;
And you guys don't remember anything?
SARAH JANE:
No.
LAURA:
Someone that you saw, someone that struck you as odd?
SARAH JANE:
El zilcho. But 
Dagons
 do have a ton of sambuca in them, right? So...
CARMILLA:
Well, there's the spook of the century. 
LAURA:
Feel free to stuff it.
NATALIE:
No, nothing from the time I was gone. Nothing I can remember. But before that there were the dreams.
LAURA:
The dreams?
NATALIE:
Yeah, like, I kept on having the same dream before. Like, I'm awake in the dark, in my bed, and there's something like a cat or a lizard on the floor by the bed prowling. And sometimes it was this strange figure with dark hair and a white dress standing over me. And the darkness is in my eyes and in my throat and I can't breathe.
[Carmilla whistles]
LAURA:
What is wrong with you?
CARMILLA:
Right now I'm out of soy milk.
NATALIE:
Um. I'm sorry. Um. I... I used to be... But now... I'm not, like... I'm sorry, I can't be here anymore. I have to go. Um. I really hope that it passes over you* and I hope it doesn't touch your face.
SARAH JANE:
Nat?! Um, guys, I'm really sorry. Nat's kinda PTSD about the creepy dreams, but I'm gonna go. I'm gonna talk her down. Sorry.
CARMILLA:
If someone's going around kidnapping girls, I can see why they threw those two back. Oh, sorry. Did I mess up your big break there, Lauronica Mars?
LAURA:
I am going to kill you.
