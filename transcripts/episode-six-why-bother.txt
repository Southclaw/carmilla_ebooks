EPISODE SIX: WHY BOTHER?
 more 
LAURA:
That was a real actual person who had something terrifying happen to her and all you can do* is make crappy jokes. Are you really so damaged that you're incapable of caring about anything?
CARMILLA:
And you really think you're doing anything to help that girl? To help poor Betty?
LAURA:
At least I'm trying to do something.
CARMILLA:
Oh, are you trying your very best? Because I'm sure if you stay pure of heart and really believe that that'll make a difference.
LAURA:
Well, it's better than lounging around all day pretending to be all cool and disaffected when really you're just miserable and alone.
CARMILLA:
And you really think you're doing a lick of actual good? Do you know anything you didn't know the day before she vanished? You're a child, and you understand nothing. Not about life, not about this place, and certainly not about what it takes to survive in a world that- you know what? The sooner you stop playing Lois Lane, the better off you'll be.
LAURA:
No.
CARMILLA:
What?
LAURA:
No, I'm not just gonna give up. Maybe you're right. Maybe I am a child. A nineteen year old who had never left her city limits before she got here. Who thought that university was gonna be some big adventure full of books to read and parties to dance at. Who never thought anything bad could actually happen. Well, it turns out the world doesn't work exactly how I thought it was going to. My university is creepy. And parties are full of numbskulls getting hammered and girls go missing and nobody seems to care. So, maybe that's just the way it is, but that does not mean that I have to accept it. I deserve better. Betty deserves better. Hell, even you deserve better.
CARMILLA:
What are you doing?
LAURA:
Putting my journalism project up online so that all the students at Silas can see it. And if anyone knows anything about Betty and the other missing girls, then they can help. We can do this together.
CARMILLA:
That'll be awfully annoying for the university. And the dean.
LAURA:
Well, then she can come and talk to me about it. 
CARMILLA:
Oh, I think she might.
LAURA:
There. It's up.
[alarms, flashing lights in the hallway]
LAURA:
What is that?!
CARMILLA:
You've done it now.
LAURA:
Is that a fire alarm?
[LaFontaine and Perry run by the door, Perry runs into the room]
PERRY:
It's a town hall meeting! They've called a town hall! Remember your training*, we've got five minutes! Run, run!
[Laura follows Perry out the door. Carmilla steals one of Laura's cookies and follows, smiling]
