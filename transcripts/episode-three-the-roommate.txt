EPISODE THREE: THE ROOMMATE
 more 
LAURA:
My what?
CARMILLA:
Your new roommate.
LAURA:
I have a roommate.
CARMILLA:
Well, don't you catch on fast.
LAURA:
No, I mean I have a pre-existing roommate. A prior roommate. Her name is Betty.
CARMILLA:
Oh, yeah? Where's she?
LAURA:
She's... missing right now.
CARMILLA:
I see. So, you can't produce this Betty or anything, but you'd like me to leave?
LAURA:
Well, I wouldn't put it exactly like tha- [Carmilla pocketing Betty's things] What are you doing?
CARMILLA:
Well, you see, I may not have this roommate, but what I do have is a letter from your dean of students that says I live here now. [going through Betty's clothes]
LAURA:
Stop that! Those are not yours. 
CARMILLA:
Well, they're in my half room, cutie. And possession is nine tenths.
LAURA:
[snatches shirt out of Carmilla's hands] This isn't your room. 
CARMILLA:
Tell you what. You cough up Betty and I'll hit the road. But until then.. [grabs shirt back]
LAURA:
Oh, this is not happening. You are not my new roommate! I'm gonna find Betty, and you're gonna be out of here so fast there's gonna be scorch marks on those leather pants of yours.
[later]
LAURA:
Well, it is day three of the incursion here in room 307 and Betty is still missing. She has been officially replaced with the roommate from hell. Don't believe me? Let's roll the surveillance. 
LAURA "(V.O.)".:
She keeps wearing Betty's clothes. She steals my chocolate. She never cleans anything. She's never awake before 4 PM, which is perhaps unsurprising when she's up all night with some girl from an anthropology class. In 
my 
bed. But it's fine, really. Because when Carmilla's latest "study buddy" came over, I may have mentioned that Carmilla has raging cold sores and she should probably get herself checked out because they are like, super contagious. Boom. Revenge is mine. And so is Carmilla's super special soy milk that I'm not supposed to touch because [imitating Carmilla] that's just the way the world works, cutie. Ha. [pours "soy milk". It's blood.] Ahh! Ahhh!
