[theme]
LAURA:
[picks up Carmilla's underwear] Eugh. I am starting to miss having Perry around. 
JP:
[at the same time] Commencing search: Campus historical records. Weapons/ Sub-class: Mystical. Override:// Access:// Restricted Stacks. Execute:// Searching...
[Laura picks up a necklace and puts it on]
LAURA:
So, with Carmilla and JP researching mystical weapons on campus— of which there are an alarming number, actually— I have decided it is time to tackle my scholastic progress or lack thereof by having a little conversation with my— [knock at the door]
[Danny enters]
DANNY:
(reluctantly) Hey, Laura. Uh, Perry said you needed to talk to me?
LAURA:
My Lit TA. Hey, Danny. You look good.
DANNY:
Thanks. And you're still filming. Even after what happened to LaFontaine.
LAURA:
Oh, god. Are you still watching?
DANNY:
Oh, no, no. Uh, not after the library. I worry too much.
LAURA:
Well, I'm glad that you still care. But if you aren't watching, then how'd you know about LaFontaine?
DANNY:
Oh, I ran into them in the hall.
LAURA:
Yeah, it's not good.
Uh, so, I was kind of hoping that I could ask you something.
DANNY:
Yeah. Of course.
LAURA:
The immediate thing of all this is that it has been very stressful.
DANNY:
Yeah. I know. I haven't exactly seen you in class lately.
LAURA:
Yeah. About that. Can I have an extension on my term paper?
DANNY:
What?
LAURA:
Just for, like, a week, until the big soul-sucking ritual I have to thwart is over. [silence]
Danny:
What?
LAURA:
Three days?
DANNY:
[sighs] Oh my god. I can't believe I thought... No, instead, you had me come all this way because you can't stay on top of your homework?
LAURA:
Seriously? Trying to save four people isn't worth 
three days
? And, wait, can't believe you thought what?
DANNY:
Nothing.
LAURA:
Did you think that I invited you over here so that we could...?
DANNY:
No, not anymore I don't! I can't believe your nerve.
LAURA:
Can't believe 
my
 nerve? I'm not the one being unfair and vindictive!
DANNY:
Well, you're not the one who got thrown over for Elvira, mistress of the snark!
LAURA:
Okay, that is so unfair.
DANNY:
No, you know what? I'm not having this conversation. If you can't keep your supernatural affairs in order long enough to get your assignments done, that's your business.
[Danny starts to leave]
CARMILLA:
Come back never.
DANNY:
This place was cleaner when you were tied up. [to Laura] Don't call me again.
[she leaves]
LAURA:
Oh my god, she hates me. Danny hates me and I'm gonna fail my Lit course. Please tell me you're having better luck with the mystical weapon situation.
CARMILLA:
Mmm, not so much. [Laura sighs] Ascalon*, an enchanted spear that kills dragons, but only if you're a Christian saint. The scepter of Kerykeion will heal them. The holy hand grenade of Antioch would be perfect for an influx of monstrous rabbits.
JP:
Match found! "The Blade Of Hastur" — Image loading...
LAURA:
Wait, what about this one? The Blade of Hastur, forged from the burnt bones of Star Spawn and meant to shatter all that oppose it. Yeah, that's...
JP:
It may or may not be sealed into the face of a cliff in an underwater cavern, like, a thousand feet below seawater... :(
LAURA:
No. 
CARMILLA:
Why no?
LAURA:
Well, it's sealed into the face of a cliff in an underwater cavern, like, a thousand feet below sea level. Nobody could survive that, which is probably the point. We just need something a little less epic quest and little more borrowed-from-the-museum-of-warfare-and-atrocities. Maybe a nice bazooka...
CARMILLA:
I could get it.
LAURA:
What?
CARMILLA:
The sword. I could get it. Pressure depth and nitrogen narcosis aren't really itches for a vampire.
LAURA:
That would be... I mean, you'd be risking your life and if your mother found out she would...
CARMILLA:
Yeah, well, my mother fed the only person I cared about to a monster and maybe I don't feel like letting that happen again.
LAURA:
Wow, that's... I mean, I know that you're not just doing it for me, but seriously...
CARMILLA:
Don't be an idiot. Of course I'm doing it for you.
[she gets up and approaches Laura]
[re: the necklace] Where'd you get that?
LAURA:
I found it here. I thought that you left it for me...
CARMILLA:
[overlapping] Get it off!
LAURA:
What?
CARMILLA:
[the necklace burns her hand] Ah!
JP:
Uh oh!
LAURA:
But... [she convulses and falls forward]
CARMILLA:
Laura. Hey, n-n-n-n-no. Laura!
JP:
[at the same time] SEARCH: Evil necklace. SEARCH: Invading spirits. SEARCH: Magical remedies. SEARCH: How to "exorcise". SEARCH: Who you gonna call? SEARCH: Jim Jasper's Ghost Tonic. SEARCH: What the heck!?!?
[Possessed Laura stands up and cracks her neck]
CARMILLA:
Mother.
THE DEAN:
Hello, sweetheart. I thought it was time we had a little talk.
