[FLASHBACK]

[FLASHBACK]
NATALIE:

[END FLASHBACK]
LAURA:
And it isn't just Natalie who isn't herself either.

SARAH JANE:
[to Kirsch] You're tall. I like you. 
LAURA:
How long has she been like this?
KIRSCH:

LAURA:
Alright, first, ugh. Secondly, I-
SARAH JANE:
Okay, no. Don't be mean to my boo. He's nice. He made me hot chocolate and he's gonna take me to the party. Yeah?
KIRSCH:

[END FLASHBACK]
LAURA:
But, I mean... That's not just kidnapping. That's... I don't even know. It's like they're whole other people. 
Danny's gone to see what she can figure out about the alchemy club guys but... I don't know. I mean, I know the alchemy club is into some pretty weird stuff, but there's a difference between prehensile cheese and turning coeds into pod people.

CARMILLA:
[waking up] Mmm... Mm... Morning. 
LAURA:
It's 5 PM.
CARMILLA:
What are you still doing here? Aren't you usually in the middle of an 18 hour workday? Wait, are you skipping class?
LAURA:
I felt sick.
CARMILLA:
Huh. You do look like crap. Well, I've got a talk I wanna catch on Goethe. So, I'll be back before Thursday [puts mug of cocoa in front of Laura]. Try not to get all sweaty and delirious before I get back.
LAURA:
Uh, thanks.
[Carmilla leaves]
Well, that was... [looks at mug] My cocoa. Of course it was.
So, after several hours of Facebook stalking, let me reintroduce to you: Elizabeth Anne Spielsdorf. High school valedictorian, mayoral page. Whatever was happening was happening before she even disappeared. And I didn't have a clue. God, what the hell is going on here?
[LaFontaine and Perry run in]
LAFONTAINE:
Laura, you gotta hide quick.
LAURA:
What?
PERRY:
The dean! The dean is coming.
[the dean gets to the doorway]
LAURA:
Uh, hi, miss dean. Can we help you?
DEAN:

LAURA:
Who?
DEAN:
Carmilla.
